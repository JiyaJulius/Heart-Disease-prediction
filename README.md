# Heart-Disease-prediction
The hybrid ensemble model aims to enhance prediction accuracy, and improve robustness by using multiple deep learning architectures. By using publicly available datasets and optimizing feature selection, this approach has the potential to advance heart disease diagnosis and predict the output accurately. Two ensemble techniques, Stacking and Soft Voting, are implemented, both achieving superior accuracy. The ensemble models also demonstrate reduced computational time and improved robustness.
The datasets used in the proposed method are taken from the widely used and openly accessible UCI repository, namely Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and another publicly available dataset named as  'heart' dataset. All these datasets are combined together as a single dataset and used for the training.
The input data consists of 13 features extracted from heart disease datasets, including attributes like age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting
blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol level (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart
rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak), the slope of the peak exercise ST
segment (slope), number of major vessels (ca), and thalassemia (thal).
The target variable is the output variable which predicts whether the patients has heart disease or not. It is a binary classification with values 0 and 1.
